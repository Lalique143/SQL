# Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data by asking the following questions.

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#1 Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2 What was the average popularity, danceability and energy of each artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,
AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#3 How many songs did Olivia Rodrigo sing and how popular were they?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
